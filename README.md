# Nokia CIMD Protocol Client

## What is CIMD?
CIMD is a dedicated data exchange protocol for connecting application programs to the Nokia Artuse service center, as well the short message service center (SMSC) and the USSD center (USSDC).
CIMD protocol packets are transmitted as text over a carrier protocol. The carrier protocol is usually TCP/IP; some operators may also still offer X.25 or plain serial modem connections.
